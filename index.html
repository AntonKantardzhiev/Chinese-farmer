            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p class="text" id="begining">
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. <br>
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <br>
                <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><br>
                The farmer said, <br>
                <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> <br>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,<br>
                and in the evening everybody came back and said, <br>
                <q class="villagers">Oh, isnâ€™t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q><br>
                The farmer again said,<br>
                <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
            </p>
            <p class="text" id="middle">
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses,<br>
                and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<br>
                <q class="villagers">Oh dear, thatâ€™s too <i class="bad">BAD</i>,</q><br>
                and the farmer responded, <br>
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q><br>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,<br>
                and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<br>
                <q class="villagers">Isnâ€™t that great!</q><br>
                Again, he said, <br>
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
            </p>
            <p class="text" id="ending">
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,<br>
                and itâ€™s really impossible to tell <br>
                whether anything that happens in it is <i class="good">GOOD</i>or <i class="bad">BAD</i> <br>
                â€” because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;<br>
                or, you never know what will be the consequences of <i class="good">GOOD</i>fortune.

        </p>
        <p>Conclusion :<br>
            <i class="good">GOOD</i>and <i class="bad">BAD</i> are just one perspective. <br>
            Bananas are <i class="bad">GOOD</i>for monkeys, but monkeys are not <i class="bad">GOOD</i>for bananas. <br>
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
